# Modal-window-using-javascript
I created a Modal + overlay window using javascript.

Nodelist:
I used 3 buttons. 
I selected all 3 buttons and got the nodelist. 
I iterate over the nodelist like a array and I attached same event listener(to show modal and overlay window) to all 3 buttons.
===


open modal window:
on clicking any one of the three buttons I display modal window and overlay window.

Close modal window:
I close the modal window when 
1. User clicks on close button or
2. user presses ESCAPE key or
3. user clicks on the overlay window.
